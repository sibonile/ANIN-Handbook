# ANIN Drought Indices Handbook
![ANIN Cover Page](assets/CoverPage1.PNG)

## Introduction

Welcome to the handbook for the ANIN South Africa Drought Monitoring Project. This project is part of the EO Africa initiative, funded by the European Space Agency (ESA), aimed at enhancing the capacity of South African stakeholders to manage drought risks through advanced Earth Observation (EO) technologies. The primary objective of this project is to develop and implement innovative drought indices tools that provide timely and accurate information to support decision-making processes.

## Objectives
1. 
**Enhance Drought Monitoring:** Develop robust drought indices that utilize EO data to provide real-time monitoring and assessment of drought conditions.
2. 
**Support Decision-Making:** Equip stakeholders with reliable tools and information to make informed decisions regarding drought management and response.
3. 
**Capacity Building:** Train local authorities and organizations in the use of EO-based drought indices tools, fostering self-reliance and sustainability.
4. 
**Promote Collaboration:** Facilitate partnerships between African institutions, international organizations, and the scientific community to advance drought resilience efforts.

## Funding and Sponsorship
The European Space Agency (ESA) created the EO Africa initiative (African Framework for Research, Innovation, Communities and Applications) to build an African-European R&D partnership to facilitate the sustainable adoption of Earth Observation and related space technology in Africa. This project is one of the four EO AFRICA' National Incubators' projects that investigate how sustainable agriculture and/or drought monitoring at a national scale can be achieved in the African continent by co-developing innovative EO-based solutions with African experts.
